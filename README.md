## Installation

Use the package manager of your choice, or don't.

**Lazy.nvim**
```lua
{
    "evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim",
},
```

**Packer.nvim**
```lua
use {
    "evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim",

## Development Plans

Of course, add more snippets. Ideally would also like to expand this to more languages, allow for better user experience in the future; feel free to make a PR to help contribute your own ideas.
