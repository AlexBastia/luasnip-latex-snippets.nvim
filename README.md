# LuaSnip-LaTeX-Snippets

A set of preconfigured snippets for LaTeX for the snippet engine LuaSnip.

**Warning:** This is currently *not* working as something to install right out of the box.

Ideally would like to expand this to more languages, allow for better user experience in the future; feel free to make a PR to help contribute your own ideas.
